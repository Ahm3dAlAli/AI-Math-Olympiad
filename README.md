<h2>ðŸŒŸ Overview</h2>
<p>The ability to reason mathematically is a critical milestone for AI. Mathematical reasoning is the foundation for solving many complex problems, from engineering marvels to intricate financial models. However, current AI capabilities are limited in this area.</p>

<p>The AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) Prize is a new $10mn prize fund to spur the open development of AI models capable of performing as well as top human participants in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This competition includes 110 problems similar to an intermediate-level high school math challenge. The Gemma 7B benchmark for these problems is 3/50 on the public and private test sets.</p>

<p>The assessment of AI models' mathematical reasoning skills faces a significant hurdle, the issue of train-test leakage. Models trained on Internet-scale datasets may inadvertently encounter test questions during training, skewing the evaluation process.</p>

<p>To address this challenge, this competition uses a dataset of 110 novel math problems, created by an international team of problem solvers, recognizing the need for a transparent and fair evaluation framework. The dataset encompasses a range of difficulty levels, from simple arithmetic to algebraic thinking and geometric reasoning. This will help to strengthen the benchmarks for assessing AI models' mathematical reasoning skills, without the risk of contamination from training data.</p>

<p>This competition offers an exciting opportunity to benchmark open AI models against each other and foster healthy competition and innovation in the field. By addressing this initial benchmarking problem, you will contribute to advancing AI capabilities and help to ensure that its potential benefits outweigh the risks.</p>

<a name="data-analysis"></a>
<h2>ðŸ“Š Data Analysis</h2>
<p>The competition data comprises 110 mathematics problems similar in style to those of the AIME. The answer to each problem is a non-negative integer, which you should report modulo 1000. If, for instance, you believe the answer to a problem is 2034, your prediction should be 34.</p>
<p>All problems are text-only with mathematical notation in LaTeX. Please see the AIMO Prize - Note on Language and Notation.pdf handout for details on the notational conventions used. Although some problems may involve geometry, diagrams are not used in any problem.</p>
<p>The public test set comprises exactly 50 problems, and the private test set comprises a distinct set of 50 problems. We also provide a selection of 10 problems for use as training data. The problems in the two test sets have been selected to balance both difficulty and subject area.</p>

<a name="feature-engineering"></a>
<h2>ðŸ§ª Feature Engineering</h2>
<p>Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy. For this competition, we need to focus on:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cleaning and preprocessing LaTeX-formatted math problems.</li>
    <li>Extracting relevant mathematical structures and symbols.</li>
    <li>Converting text into a format that can be fed into AI models.</li>
</ul>
